# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project is my first independently written implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. Itâ€™s part of my learning journey in JavaScript and aims to develop my understanding of basic coding and working with functions

Project Description:
The game allows the user to choose one of three options:
0 - Rock
1 - Paper
2 - Scissors
The computer randomly selects its choice, and the game compares the results, displaying who won the round. After 5 rounds, the game announces the final winner.

Features:
The game consists of 5 rounds.
Results are displayed after each round, showing the current score.
At the end, the game declares the overall winner.

This project was created as part of my learning process in JavaScript:
Understanding loops and conditionals.
Working with functions and parameters.
Random number generation and user input handling.
Input validation.
